# DiskWiper
DiskWiper is an open source project that allows you to erase any disk in accordance with security standards.
DiskWiper is written in C#.net and is only compatible with Windows (maybe with Linux in the future).
All comments are in French but it's very easy to understand.
This tool can wipe a disk with 1, 3, 7 or 35 passes over the total disk space or only the free space.
Any help and advice is welcome.
